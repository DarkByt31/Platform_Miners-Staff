# Platform_Miners-Staff
This app was made during SIH.

Railway Staff using this app can select the railway station and the department in which they work. After that the staff person will
start receiving the notifications when someone flags a problem. He/She can select the problems from the list which will open Maps 
with the coordinates of the problem.

After that the person can either report at that place by himself, or can send someone else to solve the problem.
